[{"comment":"Traveling from the US, you can stay in many European countries for 90 days prior to needing a visa. I don\u2019t know anything about specifically getting a French visa, but I have done my entire visa process since arriving in Germany from the US. [Due to timing with my university acceptance, I could not do any of the visa process before coming here.] \n\nI don\u2019t know your specific situation, but this is a possibility. I came very prepared with all possible documents that I thought I could need, and made my visa appointment immediately. The next available appointment when I arrived was about two months out, but that was fine because it gave me time make a bank account, get health insurance, etc. "},{"comment":"It's a Schengen visa right?\n\nSorry to say, you might be screwed. For Spain in CA, you basically had one shot and needed to schedule it months in advance, only 2 embassies. Otherwise, it's checking online and calling 2-4x\/day for a cancelled appointment.\n\nIt doesn't seem like mid-December would be enough time to get it back anyway, I think mine took 3 weeks. "},{"comment":"UPDATE: turns out I was able to schedule an appointment in Atlanta, but I've got one in NYC after all!!"},{"comment":"Where was he born? Some documents are issued in Canada by default in English and French. That would save a bit of translating. \n\nEdit to add: To more fully answer the question, there isn't really a better passport since neither is in the EU. After finishing a masters, he can get a 12-month extension to look for a job ([source](http:\/\/www.campusfrance.org\/fr\/page\/travailler-en-france-apres-ses-\u00e9tudes)).\n\nIs he already in France on a work-visa? If he's already here then he should probably be speaking with the university's international student office, or the local government."},{"comment":"How close does your friend live to a French consulate in the US? I'm not sure if it's changed since 2013 but I had to apply *in person* for my student visa and wait for my \"Campus France\" application to process before I could make my consulate appointment which took *forever*. I had to go to San Francisco for my appointment so I turned it into a vacation but aside from that it wasn't a huge deal. FWIW, dress well for your consulate appointment; the photo they took at the consulate is the one they ended up putting on my visa. I also had to pay a reciprocity fee (around $100), not sure what it costs for Canadians. \n\nedit: reread your post after writing this. Is he currently living in France? Not sure what would be required if he's already over there tbh. \n\n> he wants a visa that will allow him to look for a job at the end of his degree\n\nAside from au pairing and student jobs, student visas are *not* employment visas. His visa will likely terminate exactly as his masters is ending. At that point, he can exit the Schengen zone and return once his student visa expires (now on his 90 day Schengen visa) to look for a job. As a US\/Canadian, he has the 90 day visa-free window anyway. "},{"comment":"Sounds like a really nice friend! Definitely a motivational text OP!

Czech Republic, student visas\/ residency permits only count for half the time (eg if you studied for 4 years, it would be counted as 2), so you should check that too. \n\nHave you looked at the OFII site and related immigration info online in French and possibly in English? \nYou should call the OFII, they would have your file and all your information, much more than what we have, and could give you the right information relating to your profile.

Their policy included \"Labour will limit the 'Post Study Work Visa - Open' after graduating from a course of study in New Zealand to those who have studied at Bachelor-level or higher.\" They also planned to eliminate post study work visas for those doing Grad Diplomas as that was one of the main pathways that was leading to a drop in the average skill level of migrants.\n\nHowever none of those changes took places. Low level diploma courses still will receive a 1 or 2 year open work visa. The same with Graduate Diplomas. The predicted drop in student numbers 1,200 ! Wow way to live up to your election manifesto !\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if we didn't actually get a big increase in numbers. Those doing degrees will get a three-year post-study open work visa which will let them compete in the job market against local graduates.

Just look at how quickly he received...oh wait.  That's right.  Try as he might, he could **not** purchase a weapon.\n\n**********  ONLY CONTINUE READING IF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR HOW TOUGH IT IS TO BUY A HANDGUN IN THE USA *********\n\n\nI can't speak for the laws in 49 US states, but where I live getting a handgun requires attending a 2-3 hour safety course (my city requires that we live fire a .22 handgun at that course, not all cities do).  Ever had a DUI?  No gun for you.  Ever had a restraining order taken against you?  No gun for you.\n\nIf you're clean you may now walk into your local police station and ask to schedule an appointment to apply for a handgun LTC (License To Carry).  Whether you get the permit or not is up to the Chief of Police of the city you live in.  After you're appointment it usually takes 4-6 weeks to find out if you've been approved or not.\n\nIf you've been approved, congratulations you can now walk around strapped.  But first, you've got to purchase a gun and ammunition.  So, you go to your local gun store and ask some questions and if you decide to make a purchase another background check is run with some FBI database to make sure a restraining order wasn't issued against you that morning, or you've escaped from jail, etc.\n\nNow, if all of those steps are taken successfully, you're now the proud owner of a legal handgun in the state I live in.  During your conversation with the sales person at the gun store, if he\/she feels any reason not to sell you the gun - tough shit, they are not legally obligated to sell you shit.\n\nPurchasing non-large capacity rifles or non-large capacity shotguns is actually much easier in this state.  All you need is an FID card which is issued by your local police department and 1,000 times easier to get one as soon as you turn 18.  The FID card also allows you to purchase ammunition."},{"comment":"The whole story is fucking crazy. \n\nGood police work, good cooperation between the university administration and the feds and the local judges, and a fair bit of luck due to the fact that he left for a week for spring break which gave them time to investigate, enabled them to stop this guy before he could do any damage. \n\nHe\u2019s China\u2019s problem now. \n\nSpez:\n\n##### The second Chinese student in two weeks who was caught planning a mass shooting:\n\nhttp:\/\/archive.is\/VQveW"},{"comment":"great job by the store owner"},{"comment":"Universities really do hate Asians, don't they?

If she goes back to the UK, the Border Force Officer would likely curtail her Tier 4 visa as she is not arriving for the same general purpose for which her visa was granted.\n\nThat being said, I just read [my uni's guidance](https:\/\/www.ed.ac.uk\/global\/immigration\/at-the-end-of-your-studies\/travelling-at-end-of-studies) and the rules seems to have changed. Tier 4 visa holders apparently are now allowed to re-enter the UK if they have travelled abroad during the 'wrap up' period.\n\n>Travelling and re-entering the UK after your graduation:  \n>  \n>You should carry evidence with you to show that you intend to leave the UK before your visa expires, or that you intend to make a further immigration application (for example, a\u00a0CAS or a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for a Tier 2 job).\u00a0\n\nSo I'd ultimately recommend your SIL discusses options with her uni.

They were always advised to exit and re-enter as you plan to do when their immigration status changed from tourist to worker.\n\nSo while u\/eatallthetoast is probably giving you accurate information, I personally would play it safe and take that day trip to UK and get stamped.  Your visa expiration date is probably linked to the date of entry. Your passport may still be checked as you move around - my passport was checked at a border three times on a recent trip (France - Switzerland border and Switzerland - Italy border on an overnight train, Italy - France border on a daytime train). I was also asked to show my passport once checking into a hotel.\n\nImmigration status is not something to take lightly, and encountering a stricter border agent (or one just having a bad day) is not a risk I would take. \n"},{"comment":"If you already booked your flight why don't you just spend the day in the airport before going to immigration?
