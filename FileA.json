However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/advertising\/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* \/r\/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* \/r\/ukvisa \n* \/r\/multiculturalism\n* \/r\/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration).","number of comments":6,"subreddit":"immigration","title":"Can I get a French citizenship if I'm on a student visa?"},{"description":"A place to discuss and ask questions about any kind of visa: student, visitors, business, temporary work, etc.  \n\n**Guidelines:**  \n* Submissions who are ads for attorney services\/law firms will be removed.   \n* Attorneys and Law firms might provide guidance to redditors only if requested and through private messages.  \n* No racists\/xenophobic messages.

Please read the sidebar for general advice and helpful links.*\n\nIf you want out of wherever you live, we're here to help.\n\nGot questions?

Report and [message the mods](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.\n\n_____________\n\n**\u2605 RULES \u2605**\n\n1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration\/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting\/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin\/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc. \"\u2192 anywhere\" posts should contain some criteria for what you're looking for. Vague posts like \"guy who wants to go anywhere\" will probably be removed.\n\n4. Please reserve downvotes for rule violations or incorrect information, not just disagreement of opinion.\n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam\/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country\/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that \/r\/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates.

Please read the sidebar for general advice and helpful links.*\n\nIf you want out of wherever you live, we're here to help.\n\nGot questions?

No matter where you're from or where you're going, you're welcome here.\n\n###\u261eThis is a space to discuss strategies and advice for legal immigration, NOT to debate about refugees, undocumented migrants, the ethics\/wisdom of various immigration policies, etc. Posts and comments that stray from the subject of legal immigration will be removed and you may be warned or banned depending on the severity of the offense. Report and [message the mods](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.\n\n_____________\n\n**\u2605 RULES \u2605**\n\n1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration\/immigration. This is not a political subreddit.\n\n2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.\n\n3. When requesting\/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin\/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc. \"\u2192 anywhere\" posts should contain some criteria for what you're looking for. Vague posts like \"guy who wants to go anywhere\" will probably be removed.\n\n4. Please reserve downvotes for rule violations or incorrect information, not just disagreement of opinion.\n\n5. Recommendations are OK; spam\/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask.\nNo youtube videos unless they're in a text post with discussion.\n\n6. Please report rule violations and [message the mods](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) explaining the situation.\n\n\n**\u2605 PROTIPS \u2605**\n\n* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country\/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that \/r\/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates.

Please follow the [reddit content policy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/help\/contentpolicy). Sexist, racist and other forms of bigoted language will not be tolerated and users will be banned.\n2.

Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like \/r\/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. \n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users will be banned. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors.

Some of the links below might help.\n\n* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions \u2013 immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that \/r\/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, \"I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,\" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.\n\n* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar).

Please consult these resources before asking your question, as you might just find the answer you were looking for! If you ask a question that has been answered a million times before, expect to be downvoted. If you research online and still can't find the answer to your question, **please present the information you've already discovered**. Posts that are easily researched will be removed.\n5. Please do not attempt to ask your question in subs like \/r\/japanlife, which are intended for individuals already living in Japan. This sub was created to deter low-quality traffic from these communities.\n6. **NO POSTING LINKS TO FUNDRAISERS**. This means no Kickstarters, no GoFundMes, no PayPal donations \u2014 nothing. We are not your friends or family. If you have to fundraise to move to Japan, perhaps an international move is not right for you.\n7. No job postings or recruitment solicitations. We're not a job board. \n8. External links to relocation services, blogs, vlogs or other forms of self-promotion (including fundraisers) will be removed and users will be banned. User accounts tied to businesses will be automatically banned.\n9. No AMAs. This sub is full of people who have been in Japan for a long time, working across a variety of industries and sectors. The intent of \/r\/movingtojapan is so users wishing to move to Japan can ask questions (and get clear, unvarnished answers) from the entire community \u2014 not just from one person.\n\n**Other Japan-related subs**\n\n\/r\/japanlife - for people already living in Japan\n\n\/r\/LearnJapanese - for all your language Q&As\n\n\/r\/JapanCirclejerk - for the jaded jerk in all of us\n\n\/r\/japantravel - for those traveling to Japan short-term\n\n\/r\/teachinginjapan - for teachers past, present and prospective","number of comments":3,"subreddit":"movingtojapan","title":"What is the required amount of money to get a student visa to attend an university without a guarantor?"},{"description":"[](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheDonaldReddit) \n[](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheDonaldMovement\/) \n[](https:\/\/cgiirc.synirc.net\/irc.cgi?chan=%23trump)\n[](https:\/\/discord.gg\/PxT64vv) \n[](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/)\n####\n\n###WELCOME\n\n >Welcome to the forum of choice for The President of The United States, Donald Trump!\n\n>Be advised this forum is for serious supporters of President Trump.

Derogatory\/insulting comments and posts and comments that are unhelpful are subject to removal.\n\n2. **You must post a clear, easy to understand request for a subreddit.** There are certain technical exceptions to this that will arise on a case-by-case basis but if your post is asking for anything other than a subreddit, or if the request is very confusing or unclear, it may be removed. \n\n3. **NSFW Posts are not allowed** unless you have made a request in \/r\/NSFW411 and they were unable to answer your question. Moderators will remove NSFW posts at their discretion. \n\n4.  **No posting of personal information** or requests for personal information of anyone else (Including location).\n\n5.  **Do not suggest only that the user should use search engines.** Our users are here for our help, not sarcastic responses that they should do it themselves. If you have nothing else to say other than to check a search engine, please refrain from commenting and leave the thread to others to assist with.\n\n6. **Absolutely no joke or troll suggestions and \/ or posts.** Those that suggest sarcastic, off-topic, trolling or purely incorrect subreddits to those that are genuinely seeking help, or those that make joking \/ trolling posts may be **temporarily banned** without warning. **This especially includes posts such as \"a reddit to find reddits\".

Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/advertising\/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes.

It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes.

Reddit is not a substitute for a real lawyer.*\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n* Do not ask for advice on how to break the law. Questions about whether something is legal, what other people's experiences have been, or what the punishment is for something are legitimate. However, posts which seem to ask for a \"how to\" to break the law or avoid detection by authorities will be removed.\n* No blogspam. If the article you are posting is a short article summarizing a larger article on another site, please post the link to the larger source article.\n* Submissions and comments which are obviously adverts will be removed as spam. Even links to blog articles on attorney websites will be removed. If you really want to advertise, consider a [paid targeted reddit advertisement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/advertising\/).\n* Attorneys may offer their services to redditors who ask for help, but are discouraged from posting links to their websites in public comments. It is advised that anything that might be considered an advertisement be kept within private messages.\n* While this subreddit welcomes a wide spectrum of views on immigration, submissions promoting or obviously biased by racism or xenophobia, or that promote fear-mongering and anti-immigration sentiment will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Do not editorialize headlines. Where possible, please use the headline from the article's webpage and write your thoughts in the comments section to encourage discussion.\n* Submissions which are not obviously related to the topic of immigration will be removed.\n* To combat scams, any and all posts asking for money will be removed.\n* No images or memes. Image and memes are blocked as a spam-prevention measure, but in general aren't a very good way to foster level-headed conversation. If you have an image and believe it to be necessary and constructive to the discussion, then post it and [message the moderators](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your post for review.\n* If you believe that your post was erroneously removed, please [message the moderators](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration) with a link to your submission.\n\n**Related Subreddits:**\n\n* \/r\/IWantOut (How to migrate to a new country)\n* \/r\/ukvisa \n* \/r\/multiculturalism\n* \/r\/postnationalist\n\nIf you would like to see your subreddit's link here, please [message the moderators](\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fimmigration).","number of comments":8,"subreddit":"immigration","title":"Does my vietnamese wife need an I-94 document for change of status application if she's here on an F1 student Visa?"},{"description":"######[Want to filter out all the TRADE WAR posts?
